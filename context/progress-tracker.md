# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation change.

## Current Phase

- **Unit 01 — Project Setup: COMPLETE**
- Ready to begin Unit 02 (authentication flows and user management).

## Current Goal

- Unit 01 complete. Next: Implement student registration flow with Clerk, email verification, and role assignment.

## Completed

- Clickable HTML/CSS prototype (9 screens: landing, login, register, student dashboard, student profile, admin dashboard, excel upload, post-drive, super-admin dashboard) — used as the source of truth for `ui-context.md` and the core user flows.
- Planning conversation completed: stack, scope, and access model decided (see Architecture Decisions below).
- All six context files + this progress tracker + `CLAUDE.md` drafted.
- **Unit 01 — Project Setup (COMPLETE):**
  - Initialized Next.js 15+ with TypeScript (strict mode), App Router, ESLint
  - Configured Tailwind CSS with PostCSS and autoprefixer
  - Installed and configured shadcn/ui with components.json
  - Established CampusHire design tokens in `app/globals.css` (all color variables, Inter font, border radii)
  - Created Prisma schema with `User`, `Department`, `DepartmentAdmin`, `Student`, `Drive`, `DriveApplication`, `AuditLog` models
  - Set up Prisma client singleton in `lib/prisma.ts`
  - Created environment variable validation in `lib/env.ts` with Zod (fail-fast on startup)
  - Installed Clerk authentication, wrapped root layout with `ClerkProvider`
  - Created `lib/clerk.ts` with role-checking helpers (`getCurrentUserRole`, `hasRole`, `hasAnyRole`)
  - Established route group structure: `(auth)/`, `(student)/`, `(admin)/`, `(super-admin)/`, `api/`
  - Created placeholder pages: `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, `/student-dashboard`, `/admin-dashboard`, `/super-admin-dashboard`
  - Implemented `middleware.ts` with Clerk session protection and role-based route guarding
  - Created project folder structure: `lib/`, `components/ui/`, `components/shared/`, `features/`, `prisma/`, `scripts/`
  - **Build verification:** `npm run build` passes, TypeScript strict mode passes, ESLint passes
  - Created `.env.example` documenting all required environment variables

## In Progress

- None yet.

## Next Up

1. **Unit 02 — Authentication & User Management:**
   - Student registration flow with Clerk (college email verification)
   - Role assignment logic (store role in Clerk metadata, mirror User record in Postgres)
   - Super admin seed script (`scripts/seed-super-admin.ts`)
   - Department admin account creation flow (super admin only)
2. Define remaining Prisma schema details for student profile (academic info, skills, projects, experience, certifications, preferences).
3. Implement profile completion percentage calculation logic.

## Open Questions

- Exact list of Excel template columns and their validation rules (roll number format, required vs optional fields) — needs to be finalized before building `features/excel-upload/`.
- Whether "profile completion %" is a simple filled-required-fields ratio or weighted by section — decision made: **simple ratio across all seven required sections** per `project-overview.md`.
- Whether department admins can edit eligibility criteria on a drive after students have already applied — to be decided in the drives feature spec.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Stack**: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) + PostgreSQL via Neon + Prisma + Clerk + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, deployed on Vercel. Chosen for tight Vercel/Next.js integration and because Clerk natively supports the email-OTP verification flow needed for student sign-up.
- **Single college, multi-department**: the system is not multi-tenant. All departments belong to one institution; no college-level entity exists above `Department`.
- **File storage**: Vercel Blob for profile photos and JD PDFs only. Resume file storage is explicitly deferred (resume builder is out of scope for V1).
- **Email**: Clerk handles sign-up/OTP verification email only in V1. Drive-alert and bulk-upload-credential emails are deferred — those surface as in-app notifications for now.
- **Eligibility matching**: computed and filtered server-side; a student's drive list query only ever returns drives they qualify for.
- **Folder structure**: feature-based (`features/students`, `features/drives`, etc.) rather than layer-based.
- **Testing**: Vitest unit tests required for eligibility matching, Excel-row validation, and profile-completion logic.

## Session Notes

- V1 scope is: Auth + roles, Student profile, Dept admin (student management + Excel bulk upload), Drive posting + eligibility matching, Super admin (departments + admin accounts). Resume builder, AI analyzer, and self-assessment/readiness score are explicitly out of scope for V1 — see `project-overview.md`.
- The prototype at hand (9 static HTML pages) is the visual and flow reference for every screen — `ui-context.md` tokens were extracted directly from its `styles.css`, not redesigned.
